# Library Interpositioning

*Library interpositioning* means altering a program to the effect that
calls to library functions are intercepted and replaced with custom
implementations. Library interpositioning can be done at compile-time,
link-time or run-time.

For each of the different interpositioning methods, how is the program
changed to make the interception and redirection of library function
calls happen?

## Standard program



## Compile-time interpositioning

assembly code is different

## Link-time interpositioning

pass options to static linker

## Run-time interpositioning

uses standard program
